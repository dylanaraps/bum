`bum` is a daemon that downloads album art for songs playing in `mpd`/`mopidy` and displays them in a little window. the window can be spawned at any user specified position.  `bum` doesn't loop on a timer, instead it waits for `mpd`/`mopidy` to send a `player` event. When it receives a `player` event it wakes up and downloads album art for the current playing track. This makes `bum` lightweight and makes it idle at `~0%` CPU usage.

`bum` uses [musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) to source and download cover art, if an album is missing it's cover art you can easily create an account and fill in the data yourself. `bum` outputs a `release-id` which you can use to find the exact entry on musicbrainz.

Note: `bum` is meant to be used with files that don't have embedded album art (`mopidy-spotify`).

## New Feature

now you can specify the exact position for spawning the album art window at , using the `--position=` argument.  

![position](https://github.com/yedhink/bum/blob/displayLocation/logo/bumPosition.gif)  

refer to this graph for getting a better idea on how to position. the arrows indicate in which direction the window would be pushed.  
```bash

                             | +y |
                             |    V
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
+x --->                      |                      <---  -x

                             |
                             |    ^
